# SetAttachingKeyRequest

Request body for setting the Attaching Key on a child cell. The three values together identify the parent admin domain, the parent's cell database row, and the PAT used to authenticate the attachment handshake.
## Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **pat** | **str** | Required | Attaching Key PAT issued by the parent admin portal&#39;s &#x60;BeginCellRegistration&#x60; endpoint. Length bounds match admin-ui&#39;s &#x60;RegisterDomainPatRequest&#x60;. We apply &#x60;StringSecurityCheck&#x60; (the Finbourne.Validation catch-all that the recorded baseline tolerates for opaque strings) AND a stricter regex restricting the value to the opaque-token character set so the request body cannot smuggle in HTML/SQL/ script content even if the catch-all is later relaxed. |
| **parent_domain_name** | **str** | Required | Parent admin domain name (as entered alongside the Attaching Key by the user). Used only as the initial proposal value; the admin domain stored in the DB is the source of truth for all later operations (anti-redirection). |
| **parent_assigned_cell_id** | **int** | Optional | Database identifier of this cell in the parent admin-ui&#39;s &#x60;cell&#x60; table. Returned alongside the Attaching Key by the parent&#39;s &#x60;BeginCellRegistration&#x60; response and required to call &#x60;POST /admin-ui/api/domains/{cellId}/register&#x60; during the Finbourne.Lydia.Postgres.Database.DTO.RegistrationStep.PatPushed step. |


## Usage

### Creating from keyword arguments

```python
from finbourne.sdk.services.identity.models.SetAttachingKeyRequest import SetAttachingKeyRequest

instance = SetAttachingKeyRequest(
    pat="...",  # required — Attaching Key PAT issued by the parent admin portal&#39;s &#x60;BeginCellRegistration&#x60; endpoint. Length bounds match admin-ui&#39;s &#x60;RegisterDomainPatRequest&#x60;. We apply &#x60;StringSecurityCheck&#x60; (the Finbourne.Validation catch-all that the recorded baseline tolerates for opaque strings) AND a stricter regex restricting the value to the opaque-token character set so the request body cannot smuggle in HTML/SQL/ script content even if the catch-all is later relaxed.
    parent_domain_name="...",  # required — Parent admin domain name (as entered alongside the Attaching Key by the user). Used only as the initial proposal value; the admin domain stored in the DB is the source of truth for all later operations (anti-redirection).
    parent_assigned_cell_id=0  # optional — Database identifier of this cell in the parent admin-ui&#39;s &#x60;cell&#x60; table. Returned alongside the Attaching Key by the parent&#39;s &#x60;BeginCellRegistration&#x60; response and required to call &#x60;POST /admin-ui/api/domains/{cellId}/register&#x60; during the Finbourne.Lydia.Postgres.Database.DTO.RegistrationStep.PatPushed step.
