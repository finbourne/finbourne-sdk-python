# AggregationOptions

Options for controlling the default aspects and behaviour of the aggregation.
## Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **use_ansi_like_syntax** | **bool** | Optional | Should the aggregation behave like ANSI Sql or MySql with respect to a conceptual request which is equivalent to \&quot;select a,sum(a) from results\&quot;;  ANSI Sql would report an error if a was not unique where MySql would simply view a,suma(a) as equivalent to firstof(a),sum(a). |
| **allow_partial_entitlement_success** | **bool** | Optional | In the case of valuing a portfolio group where some, but not all entitlements fail, should the aggregation return the valuations  applied only to those portfolios where entitlements checks succeeded. |
| **apply_iso4217_rounding** | **bool** | Optional | Various results that are units of currency might need to be rounded.  This will round according to the ISO4217 standard number of decimal places for a currency. |


## Usage

### Creating from keyword arguments

```python
from finbourne.sdk.services.lusid.models.AggregationOptions import AggregationOptions

instance = AggregationOptions(
    use_ansi_like_syntax=True,  # optional — Should the aggregation behave like ANSI Sql or MySql with respect to a conceptual request which is equivalent to \&quot;select a,sum(a) from results\&quot;;  ANSI Sql would report an error if a was not unique where MySql would simply view a,suma(a) as equivalent to firstof(a),sum(a).
    allow_partial_entitlement_success=True,  # optional — In the case of valuing a portfolio group where some, but not all entitlements fail, should the aggregation return the valuations  applied only to those portfolios where entitlements checks succeeded.
    apply_iso4217_rounding=True  # optional — Various results that are units of currency might need to be rounded.  This will round according to the ISO4217 standard number of decimal places for a currency.
