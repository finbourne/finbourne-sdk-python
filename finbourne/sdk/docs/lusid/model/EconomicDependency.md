# EconomicDependency

Base class for representing economic dependencies.  Economic dependencies are a way of indicating how one concept depends upon another.  For example, when pricing an instrument with a particular model,  that model will declare that it has an EconomicDependency for each bit of market data  that it needs to complete the calculation.  Concretely, a pricing an FxForward will declare a dependency on the exchange rate between the two currencies  at the forward date.                Another example is when data is included in a data-structure only by reference.  Concretely, an object depending on a FlowConvention that is referenced only semantically via a FlowConventionName  will declare a FlowConventionDependency  so that the full data-structure of the referenced FlowConvention can be retrieved.                For deserialization purposes,  this class contains a discriminator EconomicDependencyType to indicate the derived type.
## Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |

## Usage

### Creating from keyword arguments

```python
from finbourne.sdk.services.lusid.models.EconomicDependency import EconomicDependency

instance = EconomicDependency(
    dependency_type="..."  # required — The available values are: OpaqueDependency, CashDependency, DiscountingDependency, EquityCurveDependency, EquityVolDependency, FxDependency, FxForwardsDependency, FxVolDependency, IndexProjectionDependency, IrVolDependency, QuoteDependency, Vendor, CalendarDependency, InflationFixingDependency
)
```
