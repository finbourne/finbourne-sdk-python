# NamedPrice

One recipe-defined named price: the side of the market a PV is read from, and whether the  portfolio's notional dealing cost is added (buy side) or subtracted (sell side). The buy-side  cost is always computed from the offer-side market value and the sell-side cost from the  bid-side market value, whatever the base, so a mid base with a cost is well defined.
