# FixedPeriodLookbackActivityWindow

The activity window whose since bound on each side is that side's effectiveAt less a fixed ISO 8601 period,  the same period on both sides. Stateless, so it is accepted under every effectiveAtProgression.
## Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **lookback_period** | **str** | Required | The ISO 8601 period each side&#39;s window reaches back from its effectiveAt, e.g. P1D or PT12H. Whole counts of years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds (P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S); weeks and fractions are not supported. Must be greater than zero, and applies to both sides. Evaluated in UTC, so P1D is exactly 24 hours. The since bound is exclusive. |
| **window_type** | **str** | Required | Polymorphic discriminator. Supported types: Contiguous, FixedPeriodLookback. Contiguous requires effectiveAtProgression Series; FixedPeriodLookback is accepted under any progression. Available values: Contiguous, FixedPeriodLookback, Explicit, ClosedPeriod, ContiguousAsAt. |


## Usage

### Creating from keyword arguments

```python
from finbourne.sdk.services.lusid.models.FixedPeriodLookbackActivityWindow import FixedPeriodLookbackActivityWindow

instance = FixedPeriodLookbackActivityWindow(
    lookback_period="...",  # required — The ISO 8601 period each side&#39;s window reaches back from its effectiveAt, e.g. P1D or PT12H. Whole counts of years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds (P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S); weeks and fractions are not supported. Must be greater than zero, and applies to both sides. Evaluated in UTC, so P1D is exactly 24 hours. The since bound is exclusive.
    window_type="..."  # required — Polymorphic discriminator. Supported types: Contiguous, FixedPeriodLookback. Contiguous requires effectiveAtProgression Series; FixedPeriodLookback is accepted under any progression. Available values: Contiguous, FixedPeriodLookback, Explicit, ClosedPeriod, ContiguousAsAt.
