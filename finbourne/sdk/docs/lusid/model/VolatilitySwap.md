# VolatilitySwap

LUSID representation of an OTC variance or volatility swap. A single-leg, bullet instrument with no  schedule, no interim cashflows and no accrual. Its market value is supplied by lookup pricing as  Quantity x Notional x Price / PriceDenominator, where the unit price arrives via the quote store  already netted against the strike. The variance/volatility distinction is expressed purely through the  scalar (1 for volatility swaps, 100 for variance swaps) and instrument  properties; it is not a first-class field.
## Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| **start_date** | **datetime** | Required | The start date of the instrument. This is normally synonymous with the trade-date. |
| **maturity_date** | **datetime** | Required | The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, that is not necessarily prior to its last sensitivity date for the purposes of risk; e.g. instruments such as  Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) often have sensitivities to rates that may well be observed or set prior to the maturity date, but refer to a termination date beyond it. |
| **dom_ccy** | **str** | Required | The domestic currency of the instrument, in which the looked-up price and market value are  denominated. Quotes supplied in a minor unit of this currency (e.g. GBp) are re-denominated  to it by the lookup pricer. |
| **strike** | **float** | Optional | The variance or volatility strike agreed at trade date, stored for reference only.  Not used in valuation or close-out. |
| **notional** | **float** | Required | The agreed notional for the swap. The sign conveys direction (a negative notional held long  produces a negative market value). |
| **price_denominator** | **int** | Required | Scalar divisor applied in the market value calculation:  MktVal &#x3D; Quantity x Notional x Price / PriceDenominator.  1 for volatility swaps (VOLS) and 100 for variance swaps (VARS). Must be positive. |
| **time_zone_conventions** | [TimeZoneConventions](TimeZoneConventions.md) | Optional | *No description available.* |
| **underlying** | **str** | Optional | Free-text reference label identifying the underlying index or asset (e.g. &#39;SPX&#39;, &#39;SX5E&#39;, &#39;KOSPI2&#39;).  Reference only; not used in valuation. |
| **instrument_type** | **str** | Required | Available values: QuotedSecurity, InterestRateSwap, FxForward, Future, ExoticInstrument, FxOption, CreditDefaultSwap, InterestRateSwaption, Bond, EquityOption, FixedLeg, FloatingLeg, BespokeCashFlowsLeg, Unknown, TermDeposit, ContractForDifference, EquitySwap, CashPerpetual, CapFloor, CashSettled, CdsIndex, Basket, FundingLeg, FxSwap, ForwardRateAgreement, SimpleInstrument, Repo, Equity, ExchangeTradedOption, ReferenceInstrument, ComplexBond, InflationLinkedBond, InflationSwap, SimpleCashFlowLoan, TotalReturnSwap, InflationLeg, FundShareClass, FlexibleLoan, UnsettledCash, Cash, MasteredInstrument, LoanFacility, FlexibleDeposit, FlexibleRepo, ToBeAnnounced, VolatilitySwap. |


## Usage

### Creating from keyword arguments

```python
from finbourne.sdk.services.lusid.models.VolatilitySwap import VolatilitySwap

instance = VolatilitySwap(
    start_date=datetime.now(),  # required — The start date of the instrument. This is normally synonymous with the trade-date.
    maturity_date=datetime.now(),  # required — The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, that is not necessarily prior to its last sensitivity date for the purposes of risk; e.g. instruments such as  Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) often have sensitivities to rates that may well be observed or set prior to the maturity date, but refer to a termination date beyond it.
    dom_ccy="...",  # required — The domestic currency of the instrument, in which the looked-up price and market value are  denominated. Quotes supplied in a minor unit of this currency (e.g. GBp) are re-denominated  to it by the lookup pricer.
    strike=0.0,  # optional — The variance or volatility strike agreed at trade date, stored for reference only.  Not used in valuation or close-out.
    notional=0.0,  # required — The agreed notional for the swap. The sign conveys direction (a negative notional held long  produces a negative market value).
    price_denominator=0,  # required — Scalar divisor applied in the market value calculation:  MktVal &#x3D; Quantity x Notional x Price / PriceDenominator.  1 for volatility swaps (VOLS) and 100 for variance swaps (VARS). Must be positive.
    time_zone_conventions=TimeZoneConventions(...),  # optional
    underlying="...",  # optional — Free-text reference label identifying the underlying index or asset (e.g. &#39;SPX&#39;, &#39;SX5E&#39;, &#39;KOSPI2&#39;).  Reference only; not used in valuation.
